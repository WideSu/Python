# algorithm_recursion
my understanding to recursion:

it's like you get a work that is pretty new and you dont know its meaning. the solution is to search the dictionary. when searching the dict, you found unkown words in explanation so that you keep searching those unknown words untill you totally know the meaning of one word. after knowing one word, you trace back to the word befor that and you solve that word and keep going until you find out what the first unkown word means.

the base case is same with those explanation whose meaning you totally understand.

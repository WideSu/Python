# data_structure_linkedlist
basis of linkedlist:

1.'class':

  1. object: have states and behavior and those two affect each other.
  
  2. class: it's like a blueprint. the object is like a physical thing that you build based on the blueprint.
  
2.'__init__(self,...)':

  1. you can think this function build a simple house without any equipment and furniture. the parameters you give are like furniture.
  
  2. self is unavoiable. my understanding is that you are telling the computer that you are using the specific object.
  
  3. you can ignore __init__, but this means the computer will give you an object without specific parameter.

what is linkedlist:

  think it as mutiple nodes that contain data. every nodes link with one or two other nodes. in one direction linkedlist, this means if you know the head node, you know all the node.

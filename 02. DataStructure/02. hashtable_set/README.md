# date_structure_hashtable_or_dictionary
map = hashtable = dictionary

idea of hashtable:

    1. hash function: it translate key (any immutable type) to a number such that try not to euqal to others (it is possible that two keys have same number). 
    
    2. from hash to index: the computer will use this number generated by hash function to get a index and point it to a value.
    
    3. it is possible of hash collision but the probability is relatively low. 
    
requirements of hashtable:
    
    key is any immutable type
    
advantage comparing with list:

    1. list map index to value, dictionary map key to value. but list's index is fixed, you cannot decide by yourself, while dict's key depends on how you create it.
    
    2. complexicity is different, generally dictionary has a lower O().

# pandas

The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.
